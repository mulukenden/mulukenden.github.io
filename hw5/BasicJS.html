<!-- Dear Professor,
 The link to my home page is https://mhaddis.github.io/cs472-Homework/.
 to finish the homework it took me 2:30. While doing this homework I had the chance to practice on different methods of Java Script like reduce and map
 the other thing I noticed is that the logic of writing function body is almost the same with Java. There are
 only few differences on the Syntax. After reading the lectures before doing the homework it was not challenging to do it. -->
